# Examples and Exercises from Functional Programming in C#, Second Edition By Enrico Buonanno

A place to organize examples and exercises as I work through the MEAP.

## [Pre-order the book from Manning.com](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp-second-edition)

## Requirements

  * [.net 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

## Notes
  * At the time of this writing, Visual Studio Code's C# extension doesn't seem happy with some of the top level statements with .net 6 but the code compiles and runs.
